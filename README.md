# OpenAI-Chat

This Python program is a Tkinter-based GUI application that facilitates interaction with OpenAI's GPT-3 model. Users can input their OpenAI API key, set temperature and tokens parameters, and choose a GPT-3 model. The application provides a user-friendly interface with features such as a help menu, about info, and a link to a website. The user's queries are sent to GPT-3, and the generated responses are displayed in a formatted manner. The program handles API key authentication, loading/saving from/to a file, and gracefully closes the application. It serves as a basic chat-like interface for users to interact with the GPT-3 model.
