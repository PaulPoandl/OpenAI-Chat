Help: OpenAI Chat
1. How to Use the Program:
- Enter your OpenAI API key in the 'API Key' field.
- Adjust the 'Temperature' and 'Tokens' values (explained below).
- Choose a model from the dropdown list.
- Type your query in the input box.
- Click 'Submit' to authenticate your API key.
- Once authenticated, you can click 'Send' to receive responses.
2. Tokens and Temperature:
- Tokens: It controls the length of the response. Higher values generate longer responses. Example: 2000 or 2500
- Temperature: It influences the randomness of the model's output. Higher values make the output more creative, but lower values make it more focused. Example: 1.0 or 1.5
3. Performance Note:\n
- This program is designed for educational purposes and may not match the capabilities of Chat GPT. It serves as an exploration of OpenAI's models.
- The program does not remember past communication sessions. Each interaction is independent.
- Note that the program may occasionally break or experience long loading times. Be patient if it takes time to respond.
- Choosing the right model is crucial for getting accurate and relevant answers.
4. Model Selection:
- Choose from models like 'Ada 001,' 'Babbage 001,' 'Curie 001,' and versions of 'Davinci' (002, 003).
- Each model has a different token limit. Refer to OpenAI's website for specific token limits for each model.
5. API Key:
- Get your API key from OpenAI. It's free initially, but costs may apply later.
- Visit OpenAI's website (https://beta.openai.com/signup/) to obtain your API key.
